                                  Pi Network is essentially a globally
                                  accessible online blockchain ecosystem that
                                  makes use of “Pi” – a new cryptocurrency for
                                  and by everyday people that you can “mine” on
                                  your phone for free with simplicity.
                                  Cryptocurrencies are a new form of digital
                                  money maintained and secured by a community,
                                  instead of by governments or banks. Today, you
                                  can mine Pi by making diverse contributions to
                                  the ecosystem, namely, helping to secure the
                                  blockchain, grow Pi’s trusted network, run a
                                  Node, and engage with the Pi app ecosystem.
                                  While most cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin)
                                  have been very hard for everyday people to use
                                  and access, Pi puts the power of
                                  cryptocurrency into the palm of your hand.

                                    energy. Pi’s consensus algorithm is adapted

                                    and an algorithm called Federated Byzantine

                                  app on the Pi Browser. Create your Wallet by
                                  downloading the Pi Browser app from the Google
                                  Play Store or iOS App Store and logging into
                                  your account on the Browser through your Pi
                                  mining app. Then you can access and follow the
                                  instructions on the “wallet.pi” page within
                                  the Pi Browser. Detailed video instructions on

                                  You are the sole owner of your Wallet’s
                                  private key in the form of a passphrase, which
                                  is generated locally on your phone and never
                                  comes to Pi’s servers. Your public key is also
                                  disclosed to you in the wallet creation
                                  process, and is supposed to be publicly
                                  visible like on any other blockchain. Make
                                  sure to store your Wallet passphrase
                                  (equivalent to your private key) in a secure
                                  location, and don’t share it with anyone else.
                                  Due to its noncustodial nature, the Wallet
                                  will not be recoverable from Pi Network’s
                                  servers. Once you complete KYC and your Pi
                                  Transferable Balance is migrated to the
                                  Mainnet blockchain, you may lose all of your
                                  Wallet’s Pi if you lose this passphrase.

                                    to your Mainnet Wallet after you pass KYC
                                    (identity verification) and complete the

                                    these bonuses come from verified, real

                                    securing and growing the network). The

                                    Pi/h and halved whenever the network
                                    increased in size by a factor of 10x without
                                    a definite max supply, starting at 1,000

                                    First, the network uses a combination of
                                    third party checks (e.g., recaptcha) and
                                    natively developed machine learning
                                    algorithms to identify bots. Such checks are
                                    usually invisible to most Pioneers.</span

                                    Security Circles. At best, fake accounts
                                    would be pointing at each other with very
                                    few incoming pointers from the rest of the
                                    network. This anomaly is easy to detect with

Pi’s consensus algorithm is adapted from the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) and an algorithm called Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA), which do not require energy consumption to reach consensus in order to secure a ledger. This type of consensus algorithm requires the nodes to form quorums and exchange messages with each other based on a trust graph composed of individual quorum slices to come to a “consensus” on what the next block should be. \n\nMining is making contributions to the consensus algorithm to secure the ledger in blockchain for rewards. While POW mining requires nodes to “work” to solve mathematical puzzles to help the algorithm reach consensus and incidentally consume a lot of energy, Pi mining requires a distributed trust graph. The security circles of each individual mobile miners will aggregate into a global trust graph that will feed the consensus algorithm of the Pi blockchain. Therefore, each mobile miner is mining Pi by contributing to the intersectionality, security and feasibility of the consensus algorithm of the Pi blockchain in order to secure the Pi ledger. \n\nWhile POW miners’ contribution to those blockchains is the energy, Pi mobile miners’ contribution to Pi Blockchain is their trust relationships and the active confirming of such relationships. The heavy lifting of running the consensus algorithm based on the trust graph that the mobile phones are creating is still falling into computer nodes. In fact, the Pi Testnet already has more than 10K such computer nodes that will be soon migrated to the Pi Mainnet, placing Pi into a good path into creating a very decentralized blockchain network."

Detailed video instructions on how to create and use a Pi Wallet can be found here.\n\nYou are the sole owner of your Wallet’s private key in the form of a passphrase, which is generated locally on your phone and never comes to Pi’s servers. Your public key is also disclosed to you in the wallet creation process, and is supposed to be publicly visible like on any other blockchain. Make sure to store your Wallet passphrase (equivalent to your private key) in a secure location, and don’t share it with anyone else. Due to its noncustodial nature, the Wallet will not be recoverable from Pi Network’s servers. Once you complete KYC and your Pi Transferable Balance is migrated to the Mainnet blockchain, you may lose all of your Wallet’s Pi if you lose this passphrase.\n\nThe Pi balance visible on the Pi app (your mobile balance) may not be in the Pi Wallet yet. The mobile balance becomes transferable to your Mainnet Wallet after you pass KYC (identity verification) and complete the Mainnet Checklist in the Pi app. More and more of your mobile balance becomes transferable as your Security Circle members (and at a later stage your Referral Team members) pass KYC. KYC verification makes sure that the Pi you’ve mined along with these bonuses come from verified, real individuals.\n\nIn the Enclosed Network period of Mainnet, your Wallet can be used to send or receive Pi  peer to peer or through apps within Pi Network’s app ecosystem. In the following Open Network period, external connectivity will be allowed, so the Pi Wallet will be open to holding any types of crypto assets and external wallets can access Pi blockchain.\n\nFor more information, refer to the updated Roadmap chapter of the whitepaper draft here."

Please refer to the updated chapters of the whitepaper draft released in December 2021 (December Whitepaper) for details. \n\n \n\nIn addition to mining everyday, you can boost your individual mining rate by doing one or more of the activities below. Keep in mind that the mining stops along with all types of mining rewards when a mining session is no longer active (that is, after the end of a 24-hour mining session and before you start another mining session on the app). Therefore, it’s best to set an app notification to remind you when it is time to start a new mining session.\n\nCompleting your Security Circle to maximize Security Circle rewards. Pi’s consensus algorithm relies on a global trust graph, which is aggregated from the millions of intertwining Security Circles of individual Pioneers. Thus, a Pioneer is given an additional mining boost for each new valid Security Circle connection, up to 5 such connections. Each Security Circle member who remains active adds a boost of 20% of the base rate (up to a maximum of 100%). \nInviting your friends to mine Pi to increase Referral Team rewards. Inviting more people to join your Referral Team by sending them your invitation code (your Pi username) and mining concurrently as they mine increases your mining rate rewards. Each member who is concurrently active adds a bonus of 25% of the base rate to your hourly mining rewards. There is no limit to the number of members you can add to your Referral Team. This Referral Team rewards recognize Pioneers’ contribution to the growth of the network and the wide distribution of Pi.\nReminding your existing Referral Team to mine, so that you can maximize the concurrency of your mining together that boosts your mining rate.  \nSetting and commiting to a lockup configuration or increasing your current lockup commitment. This helps stabilize the Pi ecosystem with long term engagement.\nUsing apps on the Pi Browser directory to increase App Usage rewards.

The Node Bonus rewards are open to any Pioneer with a computer connected to the internet, and are computed based on the reliability and accessibility of the Node you are running. Node rewards also apply to running nodes on the Testnet. Community nodes can run on the Mainnet during the Open Mainnet period (more information on the whitepaper draft linked above)."

Pi aims to be the world’s most widely used and distributed cryptocurrency. To achieve that goal, Pi needed to bootstrap its network in the beginning, and therefore, incentivized its earliest members to make contributions that would set it on a path to success (e.g., securing and growing the network). The Pre-Mainnet mining mechanism began at 3.14 Pi/h and halved whenever the network increased in size by a factor of 10x without a definite max supply, starting at 1,000 Engaged Pioneers. This occurred five times before the Mainnet Phase launched on December 28, 2021 when a new mining mechanism along with a clear supply model was introduced.\n\nStarting March 1, 2022, the declining rewards issuance formula based on the supply model took effect, adjusting the systemwide base mining rate based on a monthly supply limit defined by the formula and replacing the milestone-based halving explained above. Generally, the mining rate declines month over month due to the limit of supply, the growing network size and Pioneer mining activity. This formula helps ensure that Pioneer mining rewards are within the total supply limit of 65 billion allocated for mining rewards as announced in the new chapters of the whitepaper drafts released in December 2021. This declining rewards issuance formula along with the new mining mechanism (which went into effect on March 14, 2022) balances the network’s need for growth, accessibility, longevity, and scarcity. Additionally, it right-sizes the Pioneers’ rewards for contribution to the network."

Such checks are usually invisible to most Pioneers.\n\nSecond, Security Circles, which are integral to the functioning of Pi’s consensus algorithm, also make it easy to detect fake accounts. Fake accounts will not have enough real people pointing at them via Security Circles. At best, fake accounts would be pointing at each other with very few incoming pointers from the rest of the network. This anomaly is easy to detect with computer algorithms.\n\nThird, Pi’s native, decentralized KYC solution helps validate the identity of Pioneers before they are eligible to migrate their mined mobile Pi balance onto the Mainnet blockchain.  In other words, only accounts validated as belonging to distinct real individuals will be honored on the Mainnet blockchain. KYC also acts as a final system check against bots and fake accounts. That is, even if all other methods missed out on some “bot” accounts, this Pioneer validation process will further eliminate them because bot owners will not be able to prove bots to be real people with real names and government-issued identity cards."
